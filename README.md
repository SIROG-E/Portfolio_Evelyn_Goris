## Description



This **portfolio** was updated to showcase what we have learned during our four weeks at Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp. 
We were asked to update our second homework which included an Index page, a Portfolio page, and a Contact page along with this README page.

## Review

When compared to the original, it looks pretty similar to the one provided. Links navigate to the locations they are supposed to. I had trouble adding the background picture. It worked from the beginning, but somehow it broke later. Same thing happened with the sticky footer. For this homework, I tried adding more comments.
